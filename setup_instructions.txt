docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer/composer install

cp .env.example .env

docker-compose up (-d flag to detach it, in which case it's killed with docker-compose down)

(all commands are run with [docker-compose exec :application :command]
where :application is the name of the application from docker-compose.yaml, and :command is the command you want to run)

docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker-compose exec app php artisan optimize

chmod -R o+w storage/ bootstrap/cache

docker-compose exec app npm install
docker-compose exec app npm run dev     (run production to also minify)
